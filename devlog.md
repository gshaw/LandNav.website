title: Land Nav Developer Log
---

Every wonder what a dev goes through when building an app? Here is a raw dump of some of the notes I keep while building Land Nav.

I'm glad I didn't know how much effort it was going to take before I started because I would have been too afraid to start.

A lot of the work was caused by figuring out how it should work and learning state management in Swift UI. I think I rebuilt the app 3 times before finally understanding how to efficiently architect a large scale SwiftUI app and come up with a design that I was happy with.

Feb 5

- [x] Update website with What's New information.

Feb 2

- [x] Integrate What's New functionality

Feb 1, 2024

- [x] Finalize search feature
- [x] Finalize drawing regions and routes
- [x] Finalize ruler feature

Rest of 2023

Long break to see what the market would do for the app.  Unfortunately it didn't go viral and make me 10s of thousands (or even thousands).  The feedback I recived was positive so I think I'm the right track.

I worked on and off on the next major features for search, a ruler, and routes and regions.

May 22, 2023

- [x] 1.0.1 released and available on the app store
- [x] Tested in-app purchase on my device. It works, yay, at least I've made one sale!
- [x] Continued evaluating geocoding and geosearch APIs.

May 21

- [x] Approved by Apple and released on the App Store üéâ and then taken off because I didn't submit the in-app purchase along with the app so the buy feature wouldn't work :(
- [x] Version 1.0.1 submitted
- [x] Worked on search feature using openrouteservice.org for now. I don't think I'll be able to ship with that service because rate limits are too low. Geocoding APIs are surprisingly expensive...

May 19

- [x] Create screenshots and other details for App Store
- [x] Update website
- [x] Submit 1.0.0 (107) for review
- [x] Stop navigating if location not authorized
- [x] Extract offline map state to prevent menu flashing when maps are downloading because of changing settings state
- [x] Correctly collapse expanded badges in landscape
- [x] Attempted to put elevation for map center and location expanded badges but rejected as it takes up too much room. Maybe distance and bearing section would be better?
- [x] Improved haptic feedback. Was going to add haptic when alert shows but turned out to be too much and not needed, especially when using swipe to delete which already includes a system haptic.

May 18

- [x] Hide Dark map behind developer setting
- [x] Match map contour elevation unit to app elevation unit
- [x] Add required location Info.plist entry
- [x] Launch landnav.app and point app to that URL

May 17

- [x] Restructure app state to prevent unneeded view updates
- [x] Hide marker image on compass
- [x] Fix selected badge action menus flashing when location updates
- [x] Improve layout of numeric decimal degrees
- [x] Improve layout of map action button

May 16

- [x] Fix name, detail and color (item properties) doesn‚Äôt refresh item view in Items Tab while editing color or elevation (marker properties) does cause view to update. WTF?
- [x] Correctly align data cell row label images
- [x] Fix recover deleted item does not update view
- [x] Move Zoom to Extents action into menu
- [x] Select base map in move marker sheet
- [x] Confirm to delete items
- [x] Move marker sheet allows changing map style

May 15

May 14

- [x] Improve how external apps are handled
- [x] Select Apple Maps or Google maps

May 13

- [x] Fix selecting offline map region on iPad
- [x] Markers can open Apple Weather

May 12

- [x] Add shortcut to map from items tab
- [x] Post Creating your first map with Land Nav video
- [x] Tried but failed at loading GPX file into Xcode to simulate location. File selector has .gpx files grayed out

May 11

- [x] Show notes on drawing badge when expanded
- [x] Show map cursor when my location badge is visible
- [x] Only show date in title when it will fit
- [x] Map Center item should always be visible in Items even when map has no markers. E.g., Items will only show a blank slate when there is no active map?
- [x] Post an initial video talking about the app. It doesn‚Äôt have to be good but it shouldn‚Äôt be horrible.

- [x] Send announcement to friends and SFSAR

May 8

- [x] Fix parsing DM, DD, DMS separators
- [x] Improve UTM parsing
- [x] Experiment with only using a single text field for entering coordinates. I actually think the structured editors make things more complicated than it needs to be.

- [x] Correctly round minutes and seconds
- [x] Coordinate editor can switch coordinate system
- [x] Paste coordinates into coordinate editor

- [x] Fix leading zeros in coordinate editors

May 4

- [x] Experiment with coordinate format picker getting pushed as navigation view (vs sheet). Not as good so rejected it.

- [x] Add icon image for map center my location
- [x] Map cursor uses image instead of shape
- [x] Show map center item in layer view
- [x] Experimented with customizing the large title but it uses a private API and really only allows putting an image on the trailing edge. This isn‚Äôt ideal and since it might get the app rejected I‚Äôve dropped the idea.
- [x] Set itemsTabPath to mapCenter when map center badge is shown. This might require mapCenter MapContentKind

Apr 27

- [x] Move ruler badge to top
- [x] Bottom badge uses full width

Apr 26

- [x] Investigate using ShareLink but can‚Äôt use it because no way to dismiss the share sheet. Improved ActivityView instead by making a ShareLinkHelper module

Apr 15

- [x] Rename views to match new app layout
- [x] Rename operation on Items tab by clicking navigation bar title
- [x] Rename operation on Map tab by clicking navigation bar title
- [x] Fix issues with long layer names

Apr 14

- [x] Determine if it‚Äôs possible to have 2 navigation stacks (Maps and Items) share the same path so they stay in sync. This way Location and Compass tabs don‚Äôt have a Navigation Stack but Map and Items do and they sync together.
  - [x] Yes, it‚Äôs possible but has a problem with Items tab when path is focused on a specific item.
- [x] Try experiment with separate paths
  - [x] Still too confusing
- [x] Try experiment with Maps tab selects the activeLayer and only where there is an active layer does the items tab appear.

- [x] Simplify layer images in preparation to remove active layer concept
- [x] Improve layer picker to use a save button

Apr 13: Field Testing Notes

- [x] Long pressing to create waypoints is great
- [x] Having to save waypoints sucks, most will want to be saved so that should be the default. It‚Äôs not hard to delete ones you don‚Äôt want.
- [x] Really want to have a ‚Äúmap‚Äù document with easily editable notes. I‚Äôm thinking of going back to the nav bar for maps with the title a dropdown that makes it easier to Rename title (not that useful) and description (very useful).
- [x] Interesting that the app will be shown to others so it needs to be intuitive and impressive quickly to people not used to using it. Maybe that is just pride for myself.
- [x] Need to be able to answer: what will make Land Nav better in one sentence with a compelling reason.
- [x] Land Nav is a good name

Apr 12

- [x] Compact action buttons like Maps app
- [x] Fix Publishing changes from within view updates is not allowed on HandleOnCameraChanged
- [x] Design how active layer will be removed and new marker flow using default nil layer for dropped markers and a Move Marker action sheet.

Apr 11

- [x] Accept that large data sets won‚Äôt work well for now so just disable features that will be slow for launch so that I can move on.
- [x] Accept that it‚Äôs OK to update ruler while camera is in flight because eventually ruler will be independent of the camera and same with drawing.
- [x] Correctly draw ruler when first shown without having to move camera
- [x] Do not support measuring to/from drawings (performance on Hextrex and UX issues make this problematic)
- [x] Improve performance of determining drawing point count
- [x] Show point count on Edit Points action button
- [x] For now prevent navigating drawings with > 2500 points

- [x] Fix not working close button on edit drawing.
- [x] Don‚Äôt include cursor point on drawing when camera in flight.
- [x] Don‚Äôt show ruler annotation when camera in flight
- [x] Investigate tap marker performance. No actual delay, just feels like it like because of the gesture recognizer fires on touch up I think.
- [x] Investigate delay between actions and UI update. Caused by heavy work like saving a CoreData model on the UI thread. Resolution is to run code in Task block that can still happen on the main thread but be scheduled at a later time when UI is idle.

- [x] Extract navigation annotations logic from MapView
- [x] Rename BuildAnnotations module
- [x] Map controls can be hidden

- [x] Started looking into performance issues with CoreData. Not resolved. Could be a problem.

Mar 30:

- [x] Refactor map layers and state logic. I still can‚Äôt seem to get markers to render under line layers but since I don‚Äôt want that it‚Äôs OK to move one. I still don‚Äôt fully understand Mapbox layers code because when I make the change to move markers under lines it doesn‚Äôt work. This means I have a gap in knowledge.
- [x] Simplified refresh logic so items that are removed from map don‚Äôt stay around if they were selected. E.g., when map items are refreshed the map selection and hover states are refreshed as well.

Mar 29

- [x] Refactor selected item badge to be explicit about action closures
- [x] Add Change Layer action for items

Mar 18:

- [x] Import routes and tracks as red (vs green)

Mar 13-16:

- [x] Heavily refactor database design separating Items into Markers, Drawings, DrawlingLines, DrawingPoints only to revert it all back to a better Items implementation. Turns out syncing 10,000s of tiny point records is super inefficient in iCloud and using a ValueTransformer I can save an array with a 1000 points (I think - didn‚Äôt measure) very quickly. I based most of my impressions on the volume of iCloud logs. Not very scientific but the end result is pretty good. I still don‚Äôt like how there is now an item and markerPropertites or drawingProperties but I might be able to improve that with some helper structs/objects for some views.

- [x] Prevent deleting active layer when using delete selected
- [x] Make selected layers Visible/Hidden
- [x] Show controls to make active and show/hide on LayerView. When layer is active or shown explain what that means and give the option to change it. Consider adding commands to action menu. Rejected idea, makes things more complicated. I think for now all layer controls happen in LayersView rather than moving to multiple views.

Jan 22-24:

- [x] Continued smashing head. I‚Äôve got a better understanding of state and list quirks but still not satisfied. I‚Äôm starting to document some of the issues that I find in GitHub under a new notes project using issues. This way I‚Äôll be able to share a link to others to ask for help or use as a reference of stuff to ask for help on if I ever get a chance.

Jan 20-21:

- [x] Smashing my head with understanding SwiftUI state. I‚Äôm starting to get it but I really wish I would have somebody to confirm my mental model of it. It‚Äôs frustrating because I just want a pattern that I can use for views and a set of rules to follow and I still haven‚Äôt been able to figure that out. Everything seems to be working again.
- [x] RecentlyDeletedItemsView
- [x] Show list of recently deleted items

- [x] Save document lastOpenedAt and allow sorting by that so we show the most recently used documents first
- [x] Remove document date
- [x] Show description in document list view
- [x] Remove distance away document sheet view list view. Distance away is difficult for lines and regions and I‚Äôm not sure it provides a lot of value. Something that could be added later.

Nov 23:

- [x] Refactor how map annotations so areas are drawn differently than lines
- [x] Draw region border for unmodified/modified using a line
- [x] Hide features when selected, hovered, editing using new highlighted feature state
- [x] Navigate to region navigates to center of region (easier to handle case when inside region than navigating to closets point on outside of region)

- [x] Delete Marker and Delete Line messages
- [x] Reverse line
- [x] Initial region drawing
- [x] Edit feature kind
- [x] Area units
- [x] Refactor how coordinates are managed for feature records

- [x] Add custom region icon

Nov 14-18:

- [x] Tap to toggle Distance To Dest/To Next
- [x] Show Distance and Bearing on top row

Oct 20-22:

- [x] Highlight routes on map when featureRecord selected (not just hovered)
- [x] SelectedFeature sheet shows selected waypoint or feature (or nothing)
- [x] Map selection to select myLocation and be prepared for it to select other POI
- [x] Tap map, uses 32x32 rectangle (vs point) to detect features
- [x] Tap map, if under mapCursor, if let hoverKind: select hoverKind; open sheet
- [x] Provide hepatic feedback if tapping selects something

Oct 17-19:

- [x] Lots of investigation into understanding state and SwiftUI. I think I‚Äôm starting to get it. SwiftUI likes structs and keeping state simple. ViewModels make that difficult.
- [x] Remove DocumentViewModel
- [x] Rename SelectedFeatureSheet

Oct 9-16:

- [x] Lots of refactoring getting state and styles to work correctly so that hover detecting of waypoints and routes works correctly. I needed to completely rework WaypointView to not use a view model because the center point sheet that was calling the waypoint view was initializing the view model in the initializer but then when the waypoint changed for the view, the changes weren‚Äôt getting reflected. Also, when WaypointView was listing for database changes it seemed like it was listening to every waypoint in the document! I think I fixed all this by making WaypointView dumb. I‚Äôll need to go through and look at all instances where database observation is happening to see if there is more of this going on but for now will focus on getting route drawing to work in hopes of getting to feature complete.
      Oct 7-8:
- [x] I‚Äôm a stubborn mother fucker. Finally after reading the docs and going through example code I‚Äôve been able to get FeatureState, Sources, Style layers and expressions all working to efficiently style specific features like tracks. This is going to make the app possible.

Oct 4-6:

- [x] Working on improving performance when dealing with large number of routes/tracks. Mapbox‚Äôs queryRenderedFeatures method allows using the built-in spatial index for fast look up of annotations.
- [x] I still think there is a lot of performance issues that I‚Äôm messing up with SwitUI, and especially around LocationServices causing the view to update to frequently.

Oct 2:

- [x] Zoom to routes/bounds

Sep 30:

- [x] Improve drawing sheet UI

Sep 29:

- [x] Improve design of selected/not-selected drawing lines and vertices
- [x] Show next vertex annotation when editing drawing in white

Sep 28:

- [x] Detect drawing vertex and segments under point
- [x] Snap to route vertices when drawing
- [x] Snap etc route edges when drawing
- [x] Drawing OR Waypoint can be selected

Sep 27:

- [x] DeleteDrawing operation
- [x] Done drawing operation
- [x] Show routes in document sheet
- [x] Improved Z-order of map annotations
- [x] Draw route vertices with map annotations
- [x] Route icons (based on color)

Sep 26:

- [x] Redesign drawing UI to use sheet instead of buttons/badges
- [x] Save routes in database

Sep 25:

- [x] Fix bug with edit mode in DocumentsView not removing selection and changing editMode correctly.
- [x] Decided (again) not to use pushed controllers for document sheet OR waypoint details. The app design revolves around the map for the document sheet so using a pushed controller feels too heavy. For waypoint editors the UI would be different when pushing a controller from the waypoint center point sheet vs the document sheet so didn‚Äôt even try it.

Sep 24:

- [x] Tried but rejected fading map on will disappear because it will require too much logic to handle when view might disappear but the user doesn‚Äôt complete the slide back gesture leaving a faded out view.
- [x] Refactored code in prep for document view re-organization
- [x] Consider Maps > Map (sheet contents) > mapbox map view. This would remove sheet. Allow putting a thumbnail of map bounds on details view. Tapping opens the full map. Back button from map to get contents. NO lots of work to make it functional I think and it feels more complicated. The goal is to get to the map fast.

Sep 23:

- [x] Bash head around state issues and other SwiftUI limitations

Sep 22:

- [x] Open GPX from Files.app and other apps via share screen, e.g., export from MilGPS

Sep 21:

- [x] Export description and date as GPX extension
- [x] Fix crash when moving selected waypoints
- [x] Import description and date from GPX
- [x] Export selected documents from documents view

Sep 20:

- [x] Improved camera animations and app state code
- [x] When tracking current location camera fly duration should be longer, e.g., about 1 second so that it smoothly animates between location updates. Using 200ms makes for jumps
- [x] Investigate flashing doc menu caused by refreshing polyline annotations during GPS updates. Not sure why. Spent some time removing global access to heading, location, and motion services but it didn‚Äôt help.
- [x] Possible bug with Done button when selecting documents. One time Done was shown but tapping wasn‚Äôt changing EditMode. Unable to reproduce.

Sep 19:

- [x] Add CloseButton to WaypointSheet
- [x] Clean up bottomSheet code
- [x] Try Swift 5.7 Regex, not worth changing working code
- [x] Refresh map annotations when waypoint settings (e.g., show coordinates always) is modified
- [x] Investigated published changes runtime warning: Likely a bug that will be fixed. Others are having issues with it so putting it on hold until guidance from Apple becomes available.

  - <https://www.donnywals.com/xcode-14-publishing-changes-from-within-view-updates-is-not-allowed-this-will-cause-undefined-behavior/>
- [x] Consider move of operations to AppState extensions - NO
  - Difficult to separate helper methods on AppState from user operations. I fear this will be a huge logic soup if I go this direction.
  - There is some value in having helper methods used by the operations for common actions but ideally each user action is its own Operation (or Action) enum.

Sep 17:

Sep 14:

- [x] Fix offline maps initial download getting canceled has null requiredTileCount but while downloading it was present.
- [x] Determined issues with iOS16 thanks to Stack Overflow. I‚Äôm considering going with iOS 16 but not required. A UI design tweak to not use toggling bottom bars will work around the problem and there is precedent with the Notes app in this behaviour.

Sep 13:

- [x] Rename onUpdate and onCancel to updateAction and cancelAction
- [x] Hide share button from My Location and Map Center tabs
- [x] Request location services access when viewing a map (not the map list)
- [x] On first launch show Welcome map, not maps list. It will make for a more dramatic start to see a map up front. Learning about multiple maps is something that can come later.

Sep 8:

- [x] CoordinateFormats in database

Sep 6:

- [ ] Remove waypoints from AppState. View model observes database for changes now
- [x] Redesign DocumentsView to use MVVM architecture
- [x] Rename activeDocument as currentDocument to match currentCoordinateFormat

Sep 5:

- [x] Understand SwiftUI. After many days of banging my head around SwiftUI and wondering why my list wasn‚Äôt animating because of where I would place objects I realized that when a list is annotated with animate(.default, viewModel.documentInfos) you can‚Äôt then get that documentInfos out of an EnvironmentObject and expect the list to animate correctly. Those documentInfos must be passed to the child struct and then all works as expected. This was an extremely expensive lesson to learn and I spent literally days trying to figure it out.

Aug 30:

- [x] Refactor to move all operations from reducer into view code and delete AppStore
- [x] Rename Settings to AppState
- [x] Clean up AppState

Aug 27:

- [x] Implement a good pattern for showing error messages but adopt ‚Äúlet it crash‚Äù for errors that should never fail (e.g., writes to the local database)

Aug 24:

- [x] Handle error when too big an area is downloaded
- [x] Handle error when tile limit is exceeded
- [x] Tile usage details
- [x] Add ability to sort offline maps by created At, name, tile count, disk usage

Aug 15:

- [x] Suggest waypoint name button
- [x] Cancel shows Retry or Delete buttons instead of immediately removing
- [x] Don‚Äôt restrict downloads over cellular, use system settings for that
- [x] Add OfflineMapDetailsView where it shows a map snapshot of the download region and buttons to delete, refresh, and rename.

Feb 10 - Aug 14, 2022

- [x] Fix location font size to work with large device text sizes, current at large text sizes text is truncated
- [x] Jun 5: Fix: Edit document date and click save when date picker open doesn‚Äôt dismiss sheet. Document is updated but sheet needs to be dragged to be closed as even repeated clicks to Save does nothing.

- [x] Jun 5: Move waypoints
- [x] Consider adding document name to map hud and providing a setting to hide it along with other settings to hide other information. Rejected: adds clutter and no good reason (yet) to have it.
- [x] Sort waypoints and documents

- [x] Jun 4: Add horizontal padding for description editor
- [x] Remove edit icon for waypoint description, not needed nor is it standard
- [x] Hide compass cardinal letter if navigation waypoint bearing near the cardinal value causing overlap

- [x] Fix can‚Äôt edit position format because in position format details the view keeps getting updated. Related to location being updated??

- [x] Fix random crash bug somewhat related map interactions and maybe to cancel delete confirmation but might be more subtle. Not sure how to duplicate yet. Seems to have vanished after redesigning Settings and moving each setting form into it‚Äôs own view. Possibly related??

- [x] Rethink waypoint actions
  - [x] Implement new waypoint menu
  - [x] Remove support for Project From in waypoint details

- [x] Stub plot photos (on map action menu)

- [x] Consider subheadline vs caption for away, bearing on coordinate badge, check on device
- [x] Rethink all design map controls at top and under a top right menu

  - [x] Consider map type saved as part of the map document along with 3D status
  - [x] OR Consider having global settings separate from map settings and the global settings are in one area and the map settings are in another. This still might be possible with the 1 top right menu with all map settings under Map Details or Map Layers or Map Properties or Map Data and the rest of the stuff on that menu is setting global settings
    - [x] Toggle coordinate hud
    - [x] Toggle compass heading
    - [x] Toggle track recorder status

- [x] v2: Rethink coordinate formats. I think tapping on coordinates on bottom bar should quickly allow switching the format. From the format switcher it should be possible to configure coordinate formats from another page? Needs to work with Location sheet.

- [x] v1: Re-think coordinate formats and editor to be something simpler. E.g., Have a primary format and setting to define how many alternative formats you want. Waypoint details then shows primary and all alternative formats. Menu picker allows switching primary format to any of the configured formats. I guess this is like what I have so ‚Ä¶. Maybe too complicated
- [x] Consider adding course arrow on compass
- [x] Top left compass widget animates arrow, font is sub headline? Same as what is used for badges. Bold. Reserve space for 4 digits for mils or 359d
- [x] Reduce size of compass wheel to at least have padding. Consider
- [x] Improve design of waypoint sheet to look like Maps
- [x] Coordinate HUD adds away, bearing text. E.g., 443m away, bearing 47d NE
- [x] Fix light mode on compass
- [x] Documents have user supplied date
- [x] Remove concept date and UUID from app environment, it isn‚Äôt getting used consistently and so it should be removed since it only adds complexity at this time.
- [x] Documents are used to organize waypoints, routes, tracks, notes, and drawings.
- [x] New documents have default name rather than blank to speed up creating.
- [x] Only one document is active.
- [x] You can make any inactive document active but you cannot make the active document inactive.

- [x] Consider renaming app to Awesome GPS

- [x] Refactor motion manager to act like location manger
- [x] Fix waypoint editor bug when half shown on map sheet (and maybe compass). CPU seems to be running hot when doing this and changing color and shape doesn‚Äôt reliably work. Feels like something is going crazy in an update loop
- [x] Add compass to navigate screen

  - [x] Use Gyroscope API to show pitch and roll in centre of compass
  - [x] Add hepatic feedback when rotating compass through medium ticks, e.g., every 20-30 degrees

  - [x] Show inclination gauge and read out
  - [x] Show declination on compass screen
  - [x] Rename navigation tab to ‚ÄúCompass‚Äù

- [x] Improve location format editing
- [x] Add created and updated at time stamps to waypoint details
- [x] Edit waypoint notes
- [x] Edit waypoint altitude

- [x] Remove selected waypoint from document menu, it is confusing
- [x] Tap map cursor to show MapCenterSheet
- [x] Try PositionRow (FormattedCoordinateView) on Waypoint view instead of CoordinateStack and see how it feels to use that
- [x] Make coordinate and distance bearing badges expandable on map

- [x] Snap to waypoint when scrolling map to show name on map and change distance and bearing badge content
- [x] Tap current location blue dot to show MyLocationSheet
- [x] Refactor map tap callback to return MapContentKind

- [x] Determine why app is running at 35% CPU when doing nothing but showing the map or even list of maps

  - [x] I hate to see this because it‚Äôs easy to blame MapBox but I think it is MapBox‚Ä¶
  - [x] Try: Profile MapBox example app to see how it acts with energy
  - [x] Try: MapKit app with MapBox 2D tiles to see if that is the direction I should go. This means losing the 3D view.
  - [x] Even MapKit runs high CPU on basic example. Maps are energy drainers. Be aware!

- [x] Implement go to coordinate on map center sheet to find coordinates from 105 Hikes

- [x] Course and speed on compass page always
- [x] Consider document details getting pushed into nav stack instead of presented as a sheet. NO: Decided against because when clicking show on waypoint details to get back to map view it is much nicer to simply dismiss the sheet and reveal the map vs going back multiple levels to get to map.
- [x] Redesign My Location sheet to follow patterns in Map Center

- [x] Settings all one screen. Link to coordinate formats as popup?
- [x] Consider disclosure icon in menu for 4 edit items on waypoint menu. Nope, doesn‚Äôt make sense. Normally this would mean a sub menu is appearing so hard to justify why I should be using it.
- [x] DocumentSheet details section, replace edit icon with disclosure icon
- [x] Coordinate formats shows precision
- [x] Swipe right to edit coordinate format
- [x] Replace Cancel with Close button on coordinate format picker

- [x] Redesign Waypoint sheet to follow patterns in Map Center
  - [x] When pushed in table view
    - [x] Remove close button
    - [x] Show share button in toolbar
    - [x] Consider reducing negative margin adjustment, text seems almost too tight
  - [x] Confirm delete when using bottom delete button and change from red text to primary text, confirmation delete should be red
  - [x] Consider adding Edit Altitude and Edit Description menu items -or- removing Rename and Edit Coordinate menu items
  - [x] Consider spacer(minWidth: 0) for in title to see if Cafe au Clay waypoint title can have more room. Seems to wrap too early
- [x] Ensure dismiss works as expected in both contexts (bottom sheet and pushed from document sheet)
- [x] Implement waypoint Project From
- [x] Implement waypoint Rename
- [x] Consider moving waypoint color and shape to rename editor
- [x] Sunset/sunrise cell
- [x] Moon phase cell
- [x] Enable globe projection
- [x] Change title to Rename for waypoint name and mark editor
- [x] Waypoint delete button should be entire bubble?
- [x] Always confirm before deleting waypoint and making button red (destructive)
- [x] Add other actions as buttons at bottom
- [x] Declination cell has disclosure indicator to popup declination picture
- [x] GPS signal correctly shows last update and signal strength description
- [x] Rotate the moon emoji to match the moon illumination angle. Date and time moon info does this.
- [x] Consider not using monospaced for waypoint title. Just largeTitle might be fine. Yes, works well.
- [x] Map center sheet should not show distance and bearing when tracking location because it doesn‚Äôt make sense when interpolating.
- [x] My location badge should use map center when tracking to get interpolated coordinates. The sheet is doing this but the badge is not. But when not tracking use the current location coordinates. This isn‚Äôt happening which means my location sheet is not updating when not tracking.
- [x] Reconsider gps signal strength. very good, good, OK, weak, very weak. V good is < 10m
- [x] Add 2D Topo map custom url to turn on atmosphere and globe projection. Ensure globe and atmosphere is on for all map styles.
- [x] Option to show only map cursor description but not coordinate but also distance and bearing. Actual coordinate isn‚Äôt that interesting.
- [x] Info button top left of documents view brings up about sheet
- [x] Change accuracy to precision when dealing with coordinate formats. Accuracy should be for gps derived data. I don‚Äôt think they should be confused.

  - [x] Remove accuracy on coordinate format list
  - [x] Hide accuracy on coordinate for Waypoint view
  - [x] Hide accuracy on coordinate for Map Center sheet
  - [x] Show precision (renamed from accuracy) when editing a coordinate format under the fractional digits (not in the coordinate cell)

- [x] Fix bug: select waypoints on document sheet flashing and losing state

- [x] Use same font size on nav to badge as compass badge
- [x] Add my location button to compass when not navigating to waypoint. Remove altitude and declination from compass sheet since it is now available from my location. Consider always having my location be available from compass sheet.
- [x] Switch waypoint view cells to match other sheets
- [x] Add hepatic feedback when tapping on map content

- [x] Merge About and Settings leaving only Settings. Put the About page at the top of the settings. Settings gear icon in top left on Maps screen and in action menu in Map AND Maps menu so gear icon and Settings can be explicitly linked (replaces Amount menu item on Maps menu)
- [x] Convert MapCenter and MyLocation sheets to Form to have same look as WaypointForm (rename WaypointView to WaypointForm). Or consider making them all List? Waypoint probably has to be a form as it can be pushed from DocumentSheet
- [x] Implement actions on MapCenter/MyLocation sheet button and menu actions

- [x] When editing waypoint name it‚Äôs possible to lose name changes if tapping navigate before saving. A good reason to move editing name to it‚Äôs own editor so as to get rid of clear text box and make sheet layout be without a navigation bar.

- [x] Navigation waypoint map annotation not updating origin from current location. Sticks to where navigate was performed.
