### {{ page.title }}

This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is handled in Land Nav.

**Land Nav Collects No Personal Information**

I do not collect, use, save, or have access to any of your personal data recorded in Land Nav. Data created stays on the device.

Mapbox does by default collect [de-identified telemetry data](https://www.mapbox.com/telemetry). You can disable this by tapping the Mapbox icon while use the map.

Land Nav saves your data in [Apple's iCloud service](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202303) if this is enabled on your device. You can opt-out of this by disabling iCloud for Land Nav in Settings app for your device.

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, feel free to get in touch with me at gerry_shaw@yahoo.com
