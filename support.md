If you have any questions I'll try my best to quickly answer them by email at [gerry_shaw@yahoo.com](mailto:gerry_shaw@yahoo.com?subject=[Land Nav Support])

### Frequently Asked Questions

1. **Is there an Android version?** Not at this time and unlikely in near future.

2. **Do I have to buy it?** If you are getting value from the app please buy it. Currently all the features are unlocked so buying only removes the nag badge on the map but that is going to change in the future and your early support will greatly help motivate further development.

   I really don't want to go down the subscription route but there is an ongoing monthly cost to serve the maps. It's more important to me that people have access to a high quality map than it is for me to extract ever cent of profit from the app while at the same time I can't afford to do this for free.
